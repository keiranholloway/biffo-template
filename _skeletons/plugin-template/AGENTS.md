# Rules of Engagement for AI Agents

These rules are **binding for every automated coding agent** working in this
repository — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or any other. They are tool-agnostic:
express everything as plain `git` / `gh` / `pnpm` / `uv` commands. Tool-specific
guidance belongs in that tool's own file (e.g. `CLAUDE.md`), which imports this
one rather than restating it.

This is a **Biffo satellite repo** — a repository in the estate that is not a
core project: a sibling app, a plugin, a shared package, a runner fleet, or a
design/data repo. It follows the same engagement rules as every Biffo repo; only
its product differs. `CLAUDE.md` says which one this is.

This file is distributed by the template and kept in step by
`scripts/shared-sync.sh` there (`shared-files.json`). Edit it **upstream in
`biffo-template`**, not here: a local edit is overwritten by the next sync, and
`AGENTS.md` silently drifting 68 lines behind is why that mechanism exists
(biffo-template#559, #1150).

## 1. One integration branch: `dev`

- **`dev` is the integration branch** — you branch from it and open every PR back
  into it; `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef` confirms it. If it reports
  anything other than `dev`, flag it rather than working around it. (A sibling app
  also carries `staging` and a reserved `main`/production branch as promotion
  targets — production not built yet; a plugin repo has `dev` only. Either way you
  work off `dev`.)
- **All changes land via PR.** No direct commits to `dev`, no force-pushes to it.
  Branch protection stays on.
- Never leave the primary checkout parked on a feature branch or let it fall
  behind — keep it on `dev`, no more than a `git fetch` behind, and do the work
  in worktrees (§2).

## 2. Work in an isolated worktree

- **Always start from a freshly-fetched `dev`:** `git fetch origin`, then
  `git worktree add .worktrees/<name> -b <type>/<slug> origin/dev`. Never branch
  from a stale local ref.
- **Install dependencies in the new worktree before working** — `uv sync` and/or
  `pnpm install`, so the local gates (pre-push checks, lint-staged) run against
  fresh deps, not a stale `.venv`/`node_modules`.
- **One worktree per unit of work**, under the git-ignored `.worktrees/`.
- **Clean up when the PR merges:** `git worktree remove .worktrees/<name>`, then
  let the branch be deleted. Keep `git worktree list` short and every entry live.

### Check before you start, and push early

**Before starting work on an issue, run:**

```bash
sh scripts/claim.sh <issue-number> [-R owner/repo]   # 0 free · 1 taken · 2 cannot tell
```

Several agent sessions run against this estate at once. The script asks four
questions, because the answer lives in more than one place: does the issue carry
the `in-progress` label, is there an **open PR** referencing it, is there a
**remote branch** naming it, and has a PR already merged that closes it. If it
reports free, it claims the issue for you.

**Exit 2 is "cannot tell" and is never "free".** An unreadable issue or an
unauthenticated `gh` must stop you, not wave you through.

**Why four signals rather than the label alone.** The label is a
hand-maintained second copy of something git already knows: a branch exists, a
PR exists. Those are automatic — you cannot do the work without creating them —
while the label is a separate action someone has to remember. On 2026-08-03 four
sessions collided in one morning, and **three of the four were "work exists,
label does not"**. Checking only the label would have caught one of four.

**Push your branch as soon as it exists.** A local worktree is invisible to
every other machine; the pushed branch is the only signal they can see. The
window between starting and pushing is where collisions actually happen — one of
that morning's issues went from branch to **merged in three minutes**.

**Release what you claim.** Remove the label when the PR merges, when you close
the issue, or when you stop — including when you stop because someone else got
there first. A claim you never release is worse than no claim, because the next
session believes it. Before skipping something because it is claimed, check how
old the claim is: no activity for over an hour probably means abandoned. Steal
it deliberately and say so in a comment; never steal a fresh one.

## 3. Commits

- **Conventional Commits** (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `infra`,
  `security`, `refactor`, `perf`, `ci`), enforced by commitlint.
- Tag your commits with your agent's own `Co-Authored-By:` trailer.
- Keep commits and PRs **scoped to one concern**.

## 4. Pull requests

- Link the issue the PR resolves (`Closes #N`) and describe what changed and why.
- Mark a PR **ready** (not draft) when it is meant to merge.
- Behavior changes ship **with tests**. Don't reduce coverage to make CI pass.

## 5. Merging — never merge red

- Get CI green and confirm it: `gh pr checks <N>`. A green local run is not
  sufficient — verify the actual PR checks.
- **Wait with `scripts/wait-for-checks.sh`, not a hand-rolled loop:**

  ```bash
  sh scripts/wait-for-checks.sh <N>   # 0 green · 1 failed · 2 cannot tell
  ```

  Do not write your own `until … grep -c pending … done`. That polls for the
  **absence** of pending checks, so the empty window right after
  `gh pr update-branch` — superseded runs dropped, new ones not yet registered —
  reads as "all green" and merges a PR whose CI has not started. The script
  waits on a **positive** signal instead, and its **exit 2 means "cannot tell",
  which is never a pass**.

- **Squash-merge, delete the branch, remove the worktree:**
  `gh pr merge <N> --squash --delete-branch`.

## 6. Push honestly, and verify the remote has your commit

- **Push with the exit status visible:** `git push origin HEAD; echo $?`. A pipe
  (`git push | tail`) reports the pipe's status, not git's — a rejected push then
  reads as success and the commit is silently lost. Never trust a "pushed"
  message printed unconditionally after a pipe.
- **Confirm the remote actually has the commit before relying on it,** especially
  before merge: `git log origin/<branch> -1`. A green PR page is not proof your
  latest local commit reached it.

## 7. Creating this repo correctly (read once, at birth)

**No `biffo` command creates a standalone plugin repo.** `biffo plugin create`
scaffolds a plugin _into an existing checkout_; a repo like this one is made by
hand. So the governance that `biffo init` and `biffo sibling create` apply
automatically is **not applied here**, and has to be set deliberately.

That gap is not theoretical: both existing plugin repos ran with **no branch
protection at all**, and `biffo-plugin-ideation#54` was merged with both CI jobs
still in progress because nothing stopped it (biffo-template#714).

After creating the repo and pushing this skeleton:

```bash
# 1. Auto-merge must be ON, or `gh pr merge --auto` merges IMMEDIATELY
#    rather than queuing — see the warning below.
gh api -X PATCH repos/<org>/<repo> -f allow_auto_merge=true -f delete_branch_on_merge=true

# 2. Protect dev, deriving the required checks from what CI actually reports.
#    Run it once CI has gone green at least twice, so there is something to derive from.
biffo check branch-protection --repo <org>/<repo> --fix

# 3. Confirm it took.
biffo check branch-protection --repo <org>/<repo>
```

> **`--auto` is not a safety net on an unconfigured repo.** With
> `allow_auto_merge` disabled, `gh pr merge --squash --auto` does not queue — it
> merges _now_ if the PR is mergeable at that instant. On an unprotected branch
> that means merging with checks still running. Steps 1 and 2 together are what
> make the documented flow behave as documented; either alone is not enough.

## 8. CI runners — two steps this repo cannot do for itself

The workflows use `runs-on: ${{ vars.RUNNER_LABEL || 'ubuntu-latest' }}`, so they
work anywhere by default and route to a self-hosted fleet when one exists. Two
things must be done **outside** this repo before its first run can succeed on a
fleet:

1. **Set the repo variable `RUNNER_LABEL`** to the fleet's label.
2. **Grant the runner GitHub App access to this repo.** The scale-up webhook only
   sees repos the App can see. Without the grant, jobs queue **indefinitely with
   no error** — and nothing in the UI distinguishes that from a slow runner. The
   first plugin repo to hit this sat queued for **1h 44m** before anyone noticed
   (`keiranholloway/biffo-runners#2`).

If a job is queued and nothing is happening, check the grant before anything
else. It is the failure that looks exactly like patience.

## 9. Security

- **Never commit secrets** (keys, tokens, credentials, `.env` values).
- **Never silently disable a security gate.** If one must be loosened, do it in
  the open and raise a tracking issue to restore it.
