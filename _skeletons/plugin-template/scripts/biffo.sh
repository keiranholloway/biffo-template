# Run the Biffo CLI, from whichever copy is correct for this repo.
#
#   - **Template** (no `biffo.core.json`): the local `cli/` workspace, through
#     tsx. The template develops the CLI, so its own CI has to exercise the code
#     in the working tree — running the published package here would test the
#     last release instead of the change under review, and a broken guard would
#     go green and only fail after publish.
#
#   - **Instance** (`biffo.core.json` present): the published package, pinned to
#     the core version this instance is actually on. Instances no longer carry
#     `cli/` at all: it is 31k lines of a scaffolding tool they never develop
#     and never deploy, and shipping it meant the template's own test suite ran
#     in every tenant's CI — where a failure could not be fixed by the repo it
#     failed in.
#
# Pinning to `biffo.core.json` rather than `@latest` keeps the guards in step
# with the core the instance runs. An instance mid-upgrade is checked by the
# version it is upgrading from, which is the one whose rules its tree follows.
#
# That last sentence is why the version is read from `HEAD` and not the working
# tree (#667). `biffo core upgrade --apply` rewrites `biffo.core.json` to the
# TARGET version before committing, so by the time the `commit-msg` hook runs
# the working tree already names a version that, by definition, may not be
# published yet:
#
#     npm error notarget No matching version found for @biffo/cli@0.133.1
#     husky - commit-msg script failed (code 1)
#
# The upgrade then cannot be committed at all, and `--no-verify` does not help
# because CI runs the same check. Reading HEAD judges the commit by the rules
# the tree currently follows, and decouples committing an upgrade from whether
# the target has reached npm yet.

# Satellites (sibling apps, plugin repos, runner fleets) carry neither

# files came from — the same pin, under a different name.
#
# Without this branch a satellite fell through to the template's `pnpm --filter`
# line and failed, so every guard a satellite ran had to be a COPIED shell
# script kept in step by hand. That is the drift surface `shared-files.json`
# exists to police: 16 files across 15 repos, roughly 240 copies, and about ten
# of the estate's guards written to police them. Giving satellites the same
# versioned CLI instances already use is what makes those copies unnecessary
# (#1109).

# NOT `pnpm --filter @biffo/cli exec tsx ...`: `pnpm exec` normalises every
# non-zero exit to 1. Verified — the CLI exits 2 and pnpm reports 1.
#
# That silently flattened the exit code of every guard this bridge runs in the
# template, and it matters now because the estate's conventions are built on a
# THREE-valued contract: 0 green, 1 failed, **2 cannot tell**, where 2 is never
# a pass (`wait-for-checks.sh`, `branch-health.sh`, `claim.sh`). Collapsing 2
# into 1 turns "I could not tell" into "it failed", which is the safe direction
# by luck rather than design — and the reverse collapse would be a fail-open.
#
# `exec` on the binary directly keeps the child's status as this script's own.
