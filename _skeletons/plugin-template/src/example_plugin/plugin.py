"""ExamplePlugin — this plugin's BiffoPluginBase implementation.

Reacts to `biffo.core/UserCreated` by logging the new user, and carries an
idempotent seed for its baseline row. Replace both with real logic for your
own plugin — this exists to show a working, correctly-wired skeleton:
constructor -> manifest loading -> `self.api` -> `@self.subscribe`, exercised
end to end by the tests in `tests/test_example_plugin.py`.

**`on_install()` / `on_uninstall()` are not invoked.** They are required by
`BiffoPluginBase` and nothing calls them, so they are no-ops here and should
be no-ops in your plugin (biffo-template#709). An earlier version of this
skeleton seeded through `on_install()` — copying that gives you a seed that
silently never runs. `seed_default_widget()` below shows where seeding
actually goes.

Modelled directly on the RBAC reference plugin's
`services/rbac/src/rbac/plugin.py` (PR #76) in the biffo-template monorepo —
see that file (and its README) for a more elaborate example with multiple
tables, an event-driven side effect, and an in-process (non-CRUD) helper.

        **This is the ASGI-lifespan self-seeding path — for tenant-scoped
        BASELINE TABLE rows (what a fresh install needs before the feature
        works at all), prefer the declared `seed` manifest block instead
        (biffo-template#1554): see `biffo.plugin.json`'s `seed` key and
        `db/seed/000_default_widget.sql`, which seeds this same table for
        every known tenant in one statement via the instance's existing
        DDL-import deploy step, with no running plugin process and no
        per-tenant request needed to trigger it.** This method stays as the
        worked example of the *other* legitimate path — a plugin's own
        runtime config, or anything that genuinely needs to run as this
        plugin's own code rather than as SQL.

        Nothing in this skeleton calls this — deliberately. **Where you call
        it from depends on what kind of plugin you are building**, and
        neither answer is `on_install()`:

        - **A plugin with an `api_ingress` ASGI app** (ADR-0021) seeds from
          its app's *lifespan*, which the shared plugin host drives on the
          first invocation of each process::

              @asynccontextmanager
              async def lifespan(app: FastAPI) -> AsyncIterator[None]:
                  await plugin.seed_default_widget()
                  yield

              app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)

          The host has to run that handshake itself, because Starlette's
          `Mount` never delivers the lifespan scope to a mounted app — until
          biffo-template#948 a plugin's own `@app.on_event("startup")` was as
          dead as `on_install()`. It runs on every cold start, so the seed
          must be idempotent (below), and Core's own seed endpoint
          `POST /api/v1/internal/plugins/me/config/seed` was itself not
          idempotent until #1000. Verify your seed; do not assume it.

        - **An event-only plugin like this one** declares no `api_ingress`,
          so it has no startup at all. Its baseline rows belong in the `seed`
          manifest block described above — the mechanism the first-party
          plugins use, now declared rather than a hand-run script.

        Idempotency: generic CRUD (issue #19) has no upsert — every POST
        creates a new row — so this lists existing widgets first and only
        creates the default one if it's missing by name, making a repeated
        cold start a no-op instead of accumulating duplicates.
