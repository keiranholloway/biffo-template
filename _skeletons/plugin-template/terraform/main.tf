# Template Terraform module for a Biffo plugin (ADR-0003 chunk 12 / issue #25).
#
# Copy this directory to modules/plugins/<name>/ inside a plugin repo (as
# terraform/, per ADR-0003 section 2's plugin repo layout) and adjust as
# needed. `biffo plugin install <name>@<minor>` copies that terraform/
# directory into the user's monorepo at modules/plugins/<name>/; the root
# config then instantiates it with a `module "plugin_<name>"` block gated on
# `enabled_plugins` (see infra/environments/dev/main.tf's "Plugin modules"
# section for the exact block shape to add).
#
# This module deliberately wraps two existing modules rather than
# reimplementing Lambda/IAM/EventBridge from scratch:
#   - modules/cloud/aws/compute — the plugin's Lambda function, with the
#     same DLQ/logging/tracing/least-privilege IAM baseline every Biffo
#     function gets.
#   - modules/cloud/aws/events (via the shared event_bus_name passed in) —
#     this module adds only the subscription rule/target/permission a
#     plugin needs to react to events on the bus the root config already
#     owns. No new bus is created.
#
# What this module does NOT do, per ADR-0002 ("no DB clients outside
# services/api/", "microservices call the API via HTTP and react to
# EventBridge events"):
#   - It never creates a database, and never receives
#     db_credentials_secret_arn — that variable is wired to the Core API's
#     Lambda only (infra/environments/dev/main.tf's module "core_api" block).
#     A plugin that needs platform data calls the Core API over HTTPS
#     (BIFFO_CORE_API_URL, see variables.tf) using the plugin SDK's
#     BiffoAPIClient, exactly like any other API consumer.
#   - It never attaches to the VPC unless var.enable_vpc_access is set to
#     true — see variables.tf's enable_vpc_access description for why.
#
# Loose coupling: this module must not reference other plugin modules or
# their resources. Each plugin is instantiated independently by the root
# config; nothing here should assume any other plugin is installed.
