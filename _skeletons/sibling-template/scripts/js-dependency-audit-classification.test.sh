# Proves js-dependency-audit.sh (#2040) distinguishes "this PR's diff
# introduced or upgraded to a vulnerable package version" from "an advisory
# was published against a version already sitting on the base branch,
# unrelated to this diff" -- rather than reporting an identical red for both.
# This is the JS side of the fix py-dependency-audit.sh already got in
# #1673; see that file's own classification test for the Python case table
# this one mirrors.
#
# The real incident this guards against: two routine npm advisories
# (GHSA-p293-qw3h-jr36 / Next.js, GHSA-82fw-gwwq-j7x9 / vitest) were
# published against packages already on `dev` on 2026-09-08/09, with no code
# change anywhere -- and turned the JS lane red on every open PR at once,
# producing 89 fleet dispatches across 61 units in 8 repos and 10 duplicate
# tickets for one classifier bug (#2040's own cost accounting). Case 1 below
# reconstructs exactly that shape: base and PR both pinned at the flagged
# version, PR diff untouched.
#
# ## Real `pnpm audit --json` shape, captured live
#
# Run against this repo's own workspace (pnpm 9.15.9, 2026-09-10):
#
#   $ pnpm audit --json
#   {
#     "advisories": {
#       "1090893": {
#         "severity": "low",
#         "module_name": "cli",
#         "github_advisory_id": "GHSA-6cpc-mj5c-m9rq",
#         "findings": [{"version": "0.0.0", "paths": []}],
#         ...

#       "vulnerabilities": {"info": 0, "low": 1, "moderate": 0, "high": 0, "critical": 0},
#       "totalDependencies": 929
#     }
#   }
#
# `.advisories` is an OBJECT keyed by an internal numeric id, not an array --
# `.advisories[]?` iterates its values the same as an array would. Each
# value carries `.severity`, `.module_name` and `.github_advisory_id`, which
# is exactly what js-dependency-audit.sh's classification reads. The fixture
# JSON below is shaped to match this real structure, not invented -- the
# OLD version of js-dependency-audit-parallel.test.sh's stub JSON carried
# only `.metadata.vulnerabilities` with no `.advisories` key at all, which
# classification silently read as zero findings (fixed alongside this file;
# see that test's own updated `_fail_json` comment).
#
# Also proves `pnpm audit` runs against a BARE lockfile copy with no install
# and no workspace context -- verified directly, not assumed:
#
#   $ mkdir /tmp/probe && cp pnpm-lock.yaml /tmp/probe/ && cd /tmp/probe
#   $ pnpm audit --json --ignore-workspace   # exits 0, real advisory output
#
# which is why the base-branch side of this comparison is a second real
# `pnpm audit` call against a `git show`-extracted copy of the lockfile,
# not a hand-rolled pnpm-lock.yaml parser.
#
# Builds a real, tiny, throwaway git repo under mktemp (never under /tmp as
# a full worktree copy -- this is a from-scratch repo with a handful of
# files, not a copy of this repository's own object store -- see AGENTS.md's
# "never create a git worktree ... under /tmp", which this is not) with a
# base branch and a PR-head state, and stubs `pnpm` on PATH so `pnpm audit
# --json` returns a canned finding selected by a marker comment inside
# whichever pnpm-lock.yaml the stub is invoked against -- no network, no
# real registry. `jq`, `git` and `grep` are used for real -- they are
# exactly what the target script itself depends on, so stubbing them would
# test nothing.

# 1. PRE-EXISTING, PR context, advisory UNCHANGED from base (the

#    at all; this diff added it at an already-vulnerable version. For the
#    advisory-ID-diffing design this is mechanically identical to case 2
#    (base's audit reports no matching id either way) -- kept as its own
#    case for documentation, matching py-dependency-audit-classification's

#    finding blocks, exactly as before this fix. Deliberately the SAME
#    lockfile shape as case 1 (unchanged advisory) to prove the difference

#    and one introduced finding (vuln-pkg-a, new to this diff) in the same
#    run. Must still block overall (the introduced one), while the
