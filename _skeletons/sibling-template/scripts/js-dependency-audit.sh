# JS dependency audit that fails the build on a real high/critical advisory but
# NOT on a broken audit registry (#591).
#
# `pnpm audit --audit-level=high` exits non-zero identically whether it found a
# vulnerability OR simply couldn't parse the registry's response — and the npm
# audit endpoint intermittently returns a non-JSON/gzip body pnpm chokes on
# ("Unexpected token, is not valid JSON"), which then fails the required JS check
# on every open PR at once, blocking the whole merge queue for an infrastructure
# hiccup that has nothing to do with the PR.
#
# `pnpm audit --json` disambiguates: a real run yields `.metadata.vulnerabilities`
# (counts by severity); a registry/parse failure yields `.error`. So we fail only
# on a genuine high+critical finding, retry a transient registry error a few
# times, and treat a persistent one as INCONCLUSIVE (warn, don't block) rather
# than as a vulnerability. "Couldn't run the check" and "the check found a
# problem" must not be the same signal on a required gate.
#
# ## Skeleton lockfiles are audited too (#644)
#
# `_skeletons/**/` are scaffolding trees: `biffo sibling create` / `plugin
# create` copy them verbatim into a brand-new repo. They sit OUTSIDE the pnpm
# workspace, so `pnpm install` never installs them and a workspace-scoped audit
# never sees them — which meant every sibling scaffolded from this template was
# born with four high-severity advisories nobody could see. Dependabot found
# them; the required JS gate could not, by construction.
#
# That is the fail-open shape this file already exists to fight, one level up:
# the gate was green because it was not looking, and "we checked and it is
# clean" read identically to "we never checked".
#
# ## Discovery, not a fixed path list (#1270)
#
# A fixed sweep of "workspace root + `_skeletons/**`" is itself the same shape
# of gap, one level further down: it reports clean on any pnpm-lock.yaml
# outside that pair, and an INSTANCE grows trees this repo never has —
# vendored plugin frontends under `services/*/web/`, a second app under
# `web-admin/`, or any other nested pnpm project. Found live:
# `services/ideation/web/pnpm-lock.yaml` sat on two advisory-range packages
# (one high) while this exact gate stayed green, because it never looked
# there. Ten lockfiles in that repo; a fixed sweep covered nine.
#
# So every pnpm-lock.yaml under the repo is DISCOVERED by walking from the git
# root, rather than assumed from a hardcoded list — see "Discover the trees"
# below. Nothing here still means the estate's layouts differ; discovery
# covers a repo the day it grows a new one, instead of the day someone
# remembers to add a path.
#
# ## This file is distributed verbatim (#743)
#
# Both skeletons and every existing sibling/plugin repo hold a BYTE-IDENTICAL
# copy, listed in `shared-files.json` and pushed by `scripts/shared-sync.sh`.
# Until then the hardening above lived in this repo only, while both skeletons
# shipped the raw `pnpm audit --audit-level=high` that #591 was filed about — so
# every satellite was born with the original defect and reddened its required JS
# check on any registry hiccup.
#
# It therefore takes its WORKSPACE tree from the CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY —
# the CI job's `working-directory` — rather than assuming a repo layout: `.` is
# the root workspace here, `apps/frontend` in a sibling. Keep it layout-agnostic,
# or the copies stop being interchangeable and `shared-sync.sh --check` starts
# reporting drift that is really divergence.
#
# ## Pre-existing vs introduced (#2040)
#
# Every check above answers "can this audit be trusted" (network flake vs a
# real finding). None of them answer WHEN the vulnerable version got there —
# so a genuine high/critical advisory published overnight against a package
# already sitting on `dev`, untouched by this diff, used to read identically
# to a PR that actually introduced the vulnerable version. #1880 (2026-09-04)
# tried to paper over exactly that by moving this whole check to a
# `continue-on-error`, non-required job — which stopped a real per-PR finding
# from blocking too, and produced ten separate biffo-fleet tickets and $86.72
# of dispatch spend for two routine advisories that no PR under test could
# have fixed (#2040's own cost accounting). `py-dependency-audit.sh` closed
# this same gap for Python in #1673; this is the JS side of the same fix.
#
# The fix compares the ADVISORY IDS found against the SAME tree's pnpm audit
# run against the PR's BASE branch, not against the diff itself: a PR can
# leave pnpm-lock.yaml untouched while a sibling change moves a transitive
# version, or the base branch may already carry the flagged version. An
# advisory ID present in both base and head is pre-existing and does not
# block; an advisory ID present only in head is introduced by this diff (a
# new dependency, or an upgrade/downgrade into a vulnerable version) and
# blocks exactly as before. This mirrors the issue's own "run against base
# and head, diff the advisory IDs, fail on head-only" design rather than
# hand-parsing pnpm-lock.yaml's YAML — `pnpm audit` already works against a
# bare copy of just the lockfile with no install (verified directly against
# this repo's own pnpm 9.15.9), so the base side is a second real audit
# call, not a reimplementation of what `pnpm audit` already does.
#
# `GITHUB_BASE_REF` is the base branch name and is set ONLY for a
# `pull_request`/`pull_request_target` event — empty on `push`,
# `workflow_dispatch` and `merge_group`. That is deliberate, not a gap:
# outside a PR there is no "diff" to attribute a finding to, so every finding
# blocks exactly as before (the correct behaviour for `dev` itself, and for
# the scheduled base-branch scan added alongside this file in #2040, which
# wants every current finding reported, not just new ones).
#
# `origin/$GITHUB_BASE_REF` must already be a resolvable local ref for the
# comparison to run at all — the `js` job's checkout uses `fetch-depth: 0`
# precisely so it is (see that job's own comment). If it is NOT resolvable
# (a shallow checkout, or a distributed copy of this script running
# somewhere that checkout is missing), comparison fails CLOSED: every
# finding blocks, same as before this fix, rather than silently waving a
# real regression through because the check could not be performed.
#
# POSIX sh (the CI step runs `sh scripts/...`, i.e. dash) — no `pipefail`.

# jq is the parser this whole distinction rests on. Without it EVERY response
# reads as unparseable, so the script reports INCONCLUSIVE on every invocation
# and the gate goes green while scanning nothing — the exact fail-open shape it
# exists to prevent, and precisely what the dash `echo` defect did until #717. A

#
# The verdict file exists because this function is invoked backgrounded (`&`,
# see the audit loop below) so the four (or however many) trees run in
# parallel rather than paying their registry round-trip one after another
# (#1874: 4 trees serially cost 15m21s in a real CI run and blew the job's
# 20-minute cap). A backgrounded call is a forked subshell — every variable it
# touches, including `inconclusive`/`failed` below, is a copy in that child
# process and vanishes when it exits. The return code has the same problem: a
# background job's exit status is only visible via `wait "$pid"`, one pid at a
# time, which is no simpler than a file and less robust (a killed/never-run
# job leaves nothing to wait on). So each invocation reports for itself, in

# invocation has finished.
#
# `$1` is the directory, `$2` a human label, `$3` extra pnpm flags, `$4` the

# at all — a brand-new lockfile or a brand-new vendored tree this diff
# itself introduced) is NOT a failure: it prints nothing and returns 0,
# because an empty set is the correct answer — there is nothing to be
