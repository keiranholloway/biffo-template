# JS dependency audit that fails the build on a real high/critical advisory but
# NOT on a broken audit registry (#591).
#
# `pnpm audit --audit-level=high` exits non-zero identically whether it found a
# vulnerability OR simply couldn't parse the registry's response — and the npm
# audit endpoint intermittently returns a non-JSON/gzip body pnpm chokes on
# ("Unexpected token, is not valid JSON"), which then fails the required JS check
# on every open PR at once, blocking the whole merge queue for an infrastructure
# hiccup that has nothing to do with the PR.
#
# `pnpm audit --json` disambiguates: a real run yields `.metadata.vulnerabilities`
# (counts by severity); a registry/parse failure yields `.error`. So we fail only
# on a genuine high+critical finding, retry a transient registry error a few
# times, and treat a persistent one as INCONCLUSIVE (warn, don't block) rather
# than as a vulnerability. "Couldn't run the check" and "the check found a
# problem" must not be the same signal on a required gate.
#
# ## Skeleton lockfiles are audited too (#644)
#
# `_skeletons/**/` are scaffolding trees: `biffo sibling create` / `plugin
# create` copy them verbatim into a brand-new repo. They sit OUTSIDE the pnpm
# workspace, so `pnpm install` never installs them and a workspace-scoped audit
# never sees them — which meant every sibling scaffolded from this template was
# born with four high-severity advisories nobody could see. Dependabot found
# them; the required JS gate could not, by construction.
#
# That is the fail-open shape this file already exists to fight, one level up:
# the gate was green because it was not looking, and "we checked and it is
# clean" read identically to "we never checked".
#
# ## Discovery, not a fixed path list (#1270)
#
# A fixed sweep of "workspace root + `_skeletons/**`" is itself the same shape
# of gap, one level further down: it reports clean on any pnpm-lock.yaml
# outside that pair, and an INSTANCE grows trees this repo never has —
# vendored plugin frontends under `services/*/web/`, a second app under
# `web-admin/`, or any other nested pnpm project. Found live:
# `services/ideation/web/pnpm-lock.yaml` sat on two advisory-range packages
# (one high) while this exact gate stayed green, because it never looked
# there. Ten lockfiles in that repo; a fixed sweep covered nine.
#
# So every pnpm-lock.yaml under the repo is DISCOVERED by walking from the git
# root, rather than assumed from a hardcoded list — see "Discover the trees"
# below. Nothing here still means the estate's layouts differ; discovery
# covers a repo the day it grows a new one, instead of the day someone
# remembers to add a path.
#
# ## This file is distributed verbatim (#743)
#
# Both skeletons and every existing sibling/plugin repo hold a BYTE-IDENTICAL
# copy, listed in `shared-files.json` and pushed by `scripts/shared-sync.sh`.
# Until then the hardening above lived in this repo only, while both skeletons
# shipped the raw `pnpm audit --audit-level=high` that #591 was filed about — so
# every satellite was born with the original defect and reddened its required JS
# check on any registry hiccup.
#
# It therefore takes its WORKSPACE tree from the CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY —
# the CI job's `working-directory` — rather than assuming a repo layout: `.` is
# the root workspace here, `apps/frontend` in a sibling. Keep it layout-agnostic,
# or the copies stop being interchangeable and `shared-sync.sh --check` starts
# reporting drift that is really divergence.
#
# POSIX sh (the CI step runs `sh scripts/...`, i.e. dash) — no `pipefail`.
set -u

# jq is the parser this whole distinction rests on. Without it EVERY response
# reads as unparseable, so the script reports INCONCLUSIVE on every invocation
# and the gate goes green while scanning nothing — the exact fail-open shape it
# exists to prevent, and precisely what the dash `echo` defect did until #717. A
# missing jq is a deterministic environment defect, not a transient registry
# hiccup, so it fails loudly instead of degrading into a permanent pass.
