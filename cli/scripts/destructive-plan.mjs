/**
 * Decide whether a Terraform plan destroys stateful infrastructure (issue #387).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `deploy-infra.yml` runs `terraform apply -auto-approve`. Nobody reads the
 * plan. A user-pool replacement or a database rebuild reads as an ordinary
 * `-/+ resource` line among dozens, and the deploy reports success either way.
 *
 * The exposure is not theoretical. Three attributes on `aws_db_instance` —
 * `identifier`, `db_name`, `username` — are derived from `project_name` and
 * force **replacement**, and in dev and staging `deletion_protection` is false.
 * So renaming the project, a plausible and innocuous-looking edit, plans a
 * destroy of the database, and CI applies it with nobody having seen the plan.
 *
 * A Cognito pool replacement of exactly this shape landed unattended during the
 * 0.50.0 upgrade. It was intended and documented; nothing about the mechanism
 * required it to be.
 *
 * ## Why plain .mjs rather than TypeScript
 *
 * This runs in the **Plan** job, which sets up Terraform and AWS credentials
 * and nothing else — no pnpm, no node_modules. Adding a dependency install to
 * three jobs to run one guard is a poor trade, so the guard has no
 * dependencies and runs on bare node.
 *
 * It is still tested: `cli/src/lib/destructive-plan.test.ts` imports this file
 * directly, the same arrangement `packaged-root-assets.mjs` already uses. The
 * logic has one home, not two.
 */

/**
 * Resource types whose destruction loses data that no re-apply can recreate.
 *
 * Deliberately a small, explicit list rather than a heuristic. A guard that
 * fires on everything gets its acknowledgement trailer added by reflex, and
 * then it protects nothing — so it fires only where a human really should stop.
 *
 * Everything absent from this list is configuration: Terraform rebuilds a
 * Lambda, a security group or an IAM role from this repo. Nothing in this repo
 * contains the rows.
