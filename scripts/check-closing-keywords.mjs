/**
 * Three guards over a PR's closing keywords, asking different questions —
 * and, since #1334, applied to every document GitHub actually honours, not
 * just the PR body.
 *
 * 1. Refuse `Closes #N` on a change whose behaviour only shows up once
 *    deployed — a path-scoped check, documented immediately below.
 * 2. Refuse a NEGATED closing keyword anywhere, on any path — see
 *    `negatedClosingReferences`. GitHub's linker has no concept of negation,
 *    so `Does not close #N` closes #N.
 * 3. Refuse a mismatch between GitHub's OWN `closingIssuesReferences` and
 *    what this file's lexical scan calls "deliberate" — see
 *    `deliberateClosingReferences` and the "3. Ground truth" section below
 *    (#1686). This is the one that reconciles the guard's model against the
 *    thing that actually acts, rather than trying to out-regex it. Extended
 *    in "3b" below (#1732) to a document `closingIssuesReferences` itself
 *    cannot see.
 *
 * ── Three documents, not one (#1334, #1362) ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * GitHub does not read only the PR body. A closing keyword in the PR body
 * shows up as a live "closes #N" link while the PR is open; a closing
 * keyword in a **commit message** is honoured too — and for a squash merge,
 * this repo's default constructs the squash commit's message from the
 * individual commits, not from the PR body. #1332 was opened with
 * `Closes #1331` and Release Guards correctly refused it (a workflow-only
 * change, deploy-only path). The PR body was corrected to `Refs #1331`, the
 * guard re-ran reading `PR_BODY`, and it passed — because the guard had only
 * ever read the body. The first commit's message still said `Closes #1331`,
 * that text reached the squash-merge commit unchanged, and #1331 closed the
 * instant the PR merged. The guard was right about what it read; GitHub read
 * something else.
 *
 * So every check in this file runs against **all** of: the PR body, the PR
 * title, and every commit's message (`messageHeadline` and `messageBody`
 * both — a keyword can sit in either). One finding in any one of them is
 * enough to trip the guard; see `documentsFor` and `assess`.
 *
 * ── 1. Closing keywords on deploy-only paths ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * GitHub closes an issue the moment a PR body carrying a closing keyword is
 * merged. For most changes that is right and convenient. For a change whose
 * correctness cannot be observed until it is running somewhere, it closes the
 * issue at the exact moment the least is known about it — the suite is green,
 * nothing has been deployed, and nobody has looked.
 *
 * This is not a theoretical tidiness rule. It has cost this estate repeatedly:
 *
 *   - #275: portal navigation landing on the raw RSC payload was diagnosed,
 *     "fixed", shipped with a drift guard and closed. On a wrong cause. It
 *     survived a teardown and redeploy before a human clicked the link.
 *   - tabsii-platform#429/#436: two independent ORM/DDL column mismatches,
 *     each green in a lane that builds its schema from the same models it is
 *     checking, each found by a 500 on a live click-through.
 *   - tabsii-platform#511 (2026-08-02): `Closes #511` auto-closed it on merge,
 *     ten minutes before the deploy that proved anything. The evidence had to
 *     be added afterwards, as a comment on an already-closed issue.
 *
 * The rule this encodes is AGENTS.md's, verbatim: *do not close an issue you
 * have not seen fixed*. Use `Refs #N`, verify against reality, then close by
 * hand with what you saw.
 *
 * ## What counts as "only shows up once deployed"
 *
 * A path list, deliberately short. Every entry is somewhere this estate has
 * actually been bitten, not everywhere a bug could hide:
 *
 *   - `infra/`, `modules/cloud/` — Terraform. `terraform validate` says the
 *     HCL parses, never that the deployed resource behaves.
 *   - `.github/workflows/` — a workflow is only really run by running it.
 *   - `db/imports/` — applied by the importer at deploy time, against a real
 *     database, in an order no unit test reproduces.
 *   - `apps/portal/` — auth flows, client-side routing and CDN behaviour, the
 *     exact trio behind #275, #1104 and #1106.
 *   - `apps/frontend/` — the same trio, under the name a SIBLING gives it.
 *     One list serves both flavours rather than a per-flavour copy: a sibling
 *     has no `apps/portal/` and this repo has no `apps/frontend/`, so each
 *     entry is simply inert where it does not apply. Two copies of this list
 *     would be two places for it to drift, which is the defect class this
 *     estate has paid for most often.
 *
 * Application code, the CLI, and `services/api/src/` are all absent on
 * purpose. A pure function with a failing-first test is genuinely proven by
 * that test, and a guard that fires on every PR teaches people to bypass it.
 *
 * ## The escape hatch, and why it is a trailer
 *
 * A `Verified-on-deploy:` trailer in the PR body allows the closing keyword.
 * It exists for the honest case — a fix already confirmed on a running
 * environment, being landed after the fact — and it asks for the evidence in
 * the same breath, so the claim lands in the PR body where a reviewer sees it
 * rather than in someone's memory.
 *
 * ## Reading the body live (#1174)
 *
 * In CI the body is read live via the GitHub API (`resolveBody`,
 * `fetchPrBodyViaGh`), not from `github.event.pull_request.body`. That value
 * is frozen at the moment the `pull_request` event fired, so both of this
 * guard's own documented remedies — edit the body to add `Refs #N`, or add a
 * `Verified-on-deploy:` line — were unable to ever turn the check green: an
 * edit does not re-trigger CI, and a re-run of the job replays the same
 * stale payload. Verified stale on #1172. See `resolveBody` for the fallback
 * to a direct `PR_BODY` (local runs and every test in this suite) and why an
 * unreadable live body fails the guard rather than passing it.
 *
 * ── 3. Ground truth: reconciling against `closingIssuesReferences` (#1686) ──
 *
 * Checks 1 and 2 above both infer intent from a regex over prose — and a
 * regex over prose can only ever be a MODEL of what GitHub's own linker does,
 * never the thing itself. PR #1680's body read (in full context) "This is
 * the one-word fix #1664 asked for" — ordinary mid-sentence prose, not a
 * deliberate `Closes #N` trailer — alongside its own explicit `Refs #1664`
 * elsewhere in the same body. GitHub's `closingIssuesReferences` nonetheless
 * read `totalCount: 1 -> #1664` while the PR was in that state: the lexical
 * shape GitHub's linker looks for does not care about sentence position, and
 * this file's `closingReferences` (check 1's hit detector) doesn't either —
 * so `assess` correctly recorded a hit, but `changedFiles` for that PR were
 * `cli/src/lib/pg-test-db-reaper.test.ts` and `scripts/pg-test-db.sh` — no
 * `DEPLOY_ONLY_PREFIXES` entry — so check 1 returned
 * `{ ok: true, reason: 'no-deploy-only-paths' }`. Release Guards reported
 * SUCCESS. Only a human rewording the body before merge kept #1664 open.
 *
 * The deploy-only-path scoping is not wrong and is NOT removed here: a
 * genuinely deliberate `Closes #N` on a path whose correctness a green suite
 * already proves is exactly the case it exists to let through. What was
 * wrong is narrower — a hit was silently PASSED whenever the paths were
 * ordinary, with nothing checking whether GitHub was actually about to act on
 * it. `deliberateClosingReferences` narrows check 1's hit detector to
 * keyword+reference pairs that read as a genuine directive — at the start of
 * the document, a line, or a sentence, optionally after a list/heading/bold
 * marker — as opposed to buried mid-sentence. If GitHub's own
 * `closingIssuesReferences` is non-empty and NOTHING in the PR's documents
 * carries a deliberate closing keyword, that is a closing-keyword hit GitHub
 * will act on that this file cannot explain as intentional — fail regardless
 * of path, because the path-scoped hazard this file was built to catch is a
 * SUBSET of "GitHub is about to close something nobody asked for", not a
 * replacement for it.
 *
 * This also happens to close a gap #1686 flagged but explicitly did NOT ask
 * to be fixed here: a closing shape GitHub's linker recognises that this
 * file's own regex does not (e.g. a reference before its keyword) would
 * previously have returned `no-closing-keyword` — hits.length === 0 — with
 * nothing to catch it. Asking GitHub directly, rather than trying to widen
 * the regex to match its exact recognition rules, structurally covers that
 * case too: `deliberateClosingReferences` would find nothing "deliberate"
 * either, and the ground-truth check would still fire. This is a consequence
 * of the design, not a claim that the widened-adjacency shape was reproduced
 * — it was not, deliberately (see #1686's own "UNCONFIRMED SECONDARY CLAIM").
 *
 * Level of fix: 3 (fail closed), not 1 or 2. The invalid state cannot be made
 * unrepresentable, because the closing keyword lives in prose an author
 * legitimately writes and there is no way to derive intent from it with
 * certainty — `deliberateClosingReferences` is a heuristic, not a parser of
 * meaning. What IS achievable, and what this does, is refuse to let our own
 * heuristic's blind spot silently diverge from GitHub's actual behaviour: the
 * two are reconciled every time, and a mismatch fails rather than passing.
 *
 * ── 3b. Ground truth's own blind spot: it never reads a commit (#1732) ───
 *
 * Section 3 above reconciles this file's lexical model against
 * `closingIssuesReferences` — but that field is itself only a MODEL of one
 * of the three documents GitHub honours: it is GitHub's ground truth for the
 * PR BODY, computed by the same markdown-aware linker that renders the PR
 * page, and it structurally cannot see a commit message at all. This repo's
 * squash-merge strategy is `squash_merge_commit_message = COMMIT_MESSAGES`
 * (confirmed via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}` → `squash_merge_commit_title`/
 * `_message`), so the actual merge commit GitHub creates is composed from the
 * branch's own commit messages, verbatim — not from the PR body at all. A
 * closing-keyword hit that lives only in a commit message is therefore
 * something GitHub WILL act on that section 3's check is a structural no-op
 * for, not a considered "safe": `closingIssuesReferences.length > 0` is
 * simply never true for it, no matter how dangerous the commit text is.
 *
 * Real instance: merging PR #1730 (this very guard's own #1686 fix)
 * spuriously closed unrelated issue #1664. Its body quoted the historical
 * bug it was fixing — "the one-word fix #1664 asked for" — inside a markdown
 * code span, so GitHub's PR-body linker correctly ignored it and
 * `closingIssuesReferences` read `[]`, exactly what section 3 checks and
 * exactly what let it through. The identical phrase reached the real squash
 * commit unchanged, in the PR's own commit message — WITHOUT a code span
 * there, because a git commit message has no markdown semantics at all: a
 * backtick in one is two literal characters, not a code-span delimiter, and
 * GitHub's push-based "closes on merge to the default branch" keyword scan
 * is a completely different mechanism from the PR-body linker, with no
 * concept of markdown to respect. #1664 closed one second after merge.
 *
 * This is also why `stripCode` cannot simply be applied to a commit-message
 * document the way it is to the body/title: doing so would make this file's
 * OWN lexical scan (`closingReferences`, `deliberateClosingReferences`,
 * `negatedClosingReferences` — checks 1 and 2 above, not just this one) less
 * sensitive than GitHub's real behaviour for that document, the same
 * "guard reads a different document from the one that acts" shape #1362
 * names, just one level further in: the guard was reading the RIGHT document
 * (#1334 already fixed that) but modelling it with the WRONG renderer's
 * rules. Every function above therefore takes a `{ code: false }` option
 * (see `documentsFor`'s `kind` tag and `assess`'s `rawScan`) that skips
 * `stripCode` for a `'commit'` document — never for `'body'`/`'title'`,
 * where a code span is genuine, GitHub-honoured protection.
 *
 * With that in place, `assess` runs a second, independent ground-truth
 * reconciliation scoped to commit documents alone, using the commit text's
 * own (now un-stripped) lexical hit as the ground truth `closingIssuesReferences`
 * can never supply: on an otherwise-safe (non-deploy-only) path, if a commit
 * document carries a hit and nothing anywhere reads as deliberate, fail —
 * `kind: 'commit-ground-truth-mismatch'`. A hit on a genuinely deploy-only
 * path is still caught by check 1 regardless, exactly as before; this only
 * closes the gap check 1 always had by design (ordinary paths pass) and
 * section 3 could not close for this one document (ground truth never
 * arrives). See `scripts/check-closing-keywords-ground-truth.test.sh` for
 * the fail-first reproduction of PR #1730's exact real shape, plus the
 * corpus cases either side of it.
 *
 * Level of fix: still 3 (fail closed), same reasoning as section 3 — a
 * commit message is prose an author legitimately writes, so intent cannot be
 * derived with certainty here either. Not made MORE strict than GitHub's own
 * closing behaviour: GitHub will act on a commit-message hit regardless of
 * position or backticks, and this check only refuses the ones this file
 * cannot explain as intentional, using the identical `deliberateClosingReferences`
 * heuristic and its identical, already-accepted trade-off (see that
 * function's docstring for two real, intentional, mid-line-parenthetical
 * closes this heuristic already did not recognise before this change,
 * unrelated to commits — this does not introduce a new blind spot, it
 * extends an existing, documented one to a new document).

 *   - NOT deliberate — `This is the one-word fix #1664 asked for` (PR
 *     #1680's real, pre-reword text — the shape #1686 is filed over): `fix`
 *     is a real closing keyword immediately followed by a real reference,

/**
 * ── 2. Negated closing keywords, on every path ───────────────────────────
 *
 * A sentence that says a PR does NOT close an issue still closes it. GitHub's
 * linker matches `close #N` and acts; it has no concept of the word before it.
 *
 * Four occurrences, three of them "fixed" by writing the rule down again:
 *
 *   - tabsii-platform#76 — the original.
 *   - tabsii-crm#133 — `tabsii-crm#141`'s body carried
 *     `## Scope note — this PR alone does not close #133`. Its squash commit
 *     carried only `Refs #133`. The issue closed on merge anyway. The lesson
 *     recorded then: *keeping a denial out of the commit is not sufficient —
 *     GitHub's linker reads the PR description text on its own.*
 *   - #1238 / #1021 (2026-08-03) — `- **Does not close #1021.**` in the body,
 *     `Refs #1021` in the commit, #1021 closed by the squash-merge.
 *
 * The recorded fix each time was a *practice*: "never write a closing keyword
 * in prose". Three occurrences produced a rule and no mechanism, and the
 * fourth was authored with that rule available. That is the argument for a
 * guard rather than another note (#1245).
 *
 * ## Why this fires on every path, unlike the check above
 *
 * The deploy-path check asks "is this closing an issue nothing has evidenced
 * yet?", so what the PR touches is the whole question. This one asks "does the
 * author's own prose contradict what GitHub is about to do?", which has
 * nothing to do with the diff. #1238 touched `scripts/` and `cli/` and the
 * deploy-path check correctly stayed silent while the issue closed anyway.
 *
 * ## Why the detection is safe to make blocking
 *
 * It is not inferring intent. It requires a negation *immediately* before a
 * closing keyword *and* a linkified issue reference — there is no reading of
 * `does not close #N` in which the author wants #N closed. Ordinary prose
 * survives it: `the fail-open the tool exists to close` has no negation and no
 * reference, and `this does not close it` has no `#N`, so GitHub would not
 * close anything there and neither does this fire.

    // confirm OR deny — the check above is a structural no-op for it, not a
    // considered "safe". Real instance: PR #1730's body quoted the phrase
    // "the one-word fix #1664 asked for" inside a markdown code span, so
    // GitHub's PR-body linker correctly ignored it (closingIssuesReferences
    // read `[]`) — but the identical phrase reached the actual squash commit
    // verbatim from the branch's own commit message, WITHOUT a code span

    // two literal characters, not a code-span delimiter), and closed #1664
    // one second after merge.
    //

    // gets from `closingIssuesReferences`, using the commit text itself as
    // the ground truth `closingIssuesReferences` cannot supply: if a commit
    // document carries a hit and nothing anywhere reads as deliberate, fail
