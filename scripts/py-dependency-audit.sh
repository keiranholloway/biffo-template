# Python dependency audit that fails the build on a real advisory but NOT on a
# broken registry/network response (#591) — same class of flake as the JS
# dependency audit (scripts/js-dependency-audit.sh), applied preventively here
# since pip-audit queries PyPI/OSV over the network per dependency and is
# subject to the same kind of transient hiccup.
#
# `pip-audit -f json` emits a `{"dependencies": [{"name", "version", "vulns"},
# ...]}` shape on a real run; a network/parse failure produces no parseable
# JSON at all (traceback on stderr, non-zero exit, empty/partial stdout). So we
# fail only when the parsed output actually contains a vulnerability, retry a
# few times on an unparseable run, and treat a persistent failure as
# INCONCLUSIVE (warn, don't block) rather than as a vulnerability.
# "Couldn't run the check" and "the check found a problem" must not be the same
# signal on a required gate.
#
# ## Skeleton lockfiles are audited too (#719)
#
# `_skeletons/**/` are scaffolding trees: `biffo sibling create` / `plugin
# create` copy them verbatim into a brand-new repo. They are NOT part of this
# repo's uv project, so `uv sync` never installs them and a workspace-scoped
# `uv run pip-audit` never saw them — which meant the Python half of every
# scaffolded sibling came from a lockfile no CI gate had ever looked at.
#
# #644 closed exactly this hole for the JS skeleton lockfile, where it had
# already cost four unseen high-severity advisories; this is the same hole one
# language over. It is the fail-open shape this file already exists to fight,
# one level up: the gate was green because it was not looking, and "we checked
# and it is clean" read identically to "we never checked".
#
# Unlike `pnpm audit --ignore-workspace`, pip-audit cannot simply be run inside
# a nested directory: it is not an installed environment, and pip-audit's
# default mode audits an environment. So we export `--frozen` requirements from
# the nested lockfile (a read of the committed lock, no re-resolution) and
# audit those with `-r`, from the workspace, which is where pip-audit is
# actually installed.
#
# ## Discovery, not a fixed path list (#1270)
#
# A fixed sweep of "workspace + `_skeletons/**`" is the same shape of gap one
# level further down: it reports clean on any uv.lock outside that pair, and an
# INSTANCE grows trees this repo never has — vendored plugin services such as
# `services/idea-scout/uv.lock`. Found live: that lockfile and
# `services/ideation/uv.lock` both sat on `cryptography@49.0.0` (CVE-2026-69247)
# while this gate stayed green, because it never looked there.
#
# So every uv.lock under the repo is DISCOVERED by walking from the git root,
# rather than assumed from a hardcoded list — see "Discover the trees" below.
#
# ## This file is distributed verbatim (#743)
#
# Both skeletons and every existing sibling/plugin repo hold a BYTE-IDENTICAL
# copy, listed in `shared-files.json` and pushed by `scripts/shared-sync.sh`.
# Until then the hardening above lived in this repo only, while both skeletons
# shipped a raw `uv run pip-audit` — so every satellite was born with the
# original defect and reddened a required check on any PyPI/OSV hiccup.
#
# It therefore takes its WORKSPACE tree from the CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY —
# the CI job's `working-directory` — rather than assuming a repo layout: `.` is
# the root project here and in a plugin repo, `services/api` in a sibling. Keep
# it layout-agnostic, or the copies stop being interchangeable and
# `shared-sync.sh --check` starts reporting drift that is really divergence.
#
# POSIX sh (the CI step runs `sh scripts/...`, i.e. dash) — no `pipefail`.
set -u

# jq is the parser this whole distinction rests on. Without it EVERY response
# reads as unparseable, so the script reports INCONCLUSIVE on every invocation
# and the gate goes green while scanning nothing — the exact fail-open shape it
# exists to prevent, and precisely what the dash `echo` defect did until #717. A
# missing jq is a deterministic environment defect, not a transient network
# hiccup, so it fails loudly instead of degrading into a permanent pass.
if ! command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "::error::jq is not installed on this runner. The dependency audit cannot tell a clean run from an unparseable one without it, and would report INCONCLUSIVE forever — a gate that is green because it never ran. Install jq."
